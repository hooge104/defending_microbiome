# Defending Earth's Terrestrial Microbiome

This repository contains code and data to reproduce analyses presented in Averill et al. 202x. Defending Earth's terrestrial microbiome (*Journal Name*). This code is written in R, Python and Javascript (Google Earth Engine) languages. 

* 20211008_global_fungi_data_sampled.csv.zip contains coordinates of global fungi observations used in this analysis.
* Supplementary_Data_File_2._Studies_and_Effect Sizes.csv contains responses, variances and associated publication DOI codes used in our meta-analysis.
* micro.restoration_meta_analysis_code.r reproduces our meta-analysis, and generates Figure 3.
* 20211011_undersampling.py performs an under-sampling analysis. This depends on a harmonized stack of global environmental layers. We detail the sources of these publicly available layers in Supplementary Data File 1, in our associated manuscript.
* undersampling_image.js generates manuscript Figure 2 - a global map of soil fungal under-sampling.
